# Hi there 👋

I'm Nicolai, co-founder and CEO of [Rhesis AI](https://rhesis.ai) – we're building open-source testing infrastructure for LLM applications and agents.

## What I'm working on

**[Rhesis AI](https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis)** – A collaborative testing platform that helps teams move from "I hope this works" to "I know this works." We believe testing LLM applications shouldn't be a solo developer activity buried in notebooks, but a team sport where engineers and domain experts work together.

Our approach:
- Open Source (MIT license) + Enterprise Edition (coming 2026)
- Flexible evaluation backend that works with your existing tools (DeepEval, RAGAS, custom metrics)
- AI-powered test generation that learns from your feedback
- Built for real collaboration between technical and non-technical team members

## Background

- 10+ years building and scaling digital products (Apps, SaaS)
- Former Managing Director at Navigating Art (art information SaaS)
- Former Managing Director at HPI Ventures (pre-seed VC)
- PhD in digital entrepreneurship; research at Hasso Plattner Institute

## Currently

- 🦆 Shipping [v0.4.2](https://github.com/rhesis-ai/rhesis/releases) with zero-config Docker setup
- 🎤 Speaking at AI conferences about collaborative testing approaches
- 👥 Building a team of 8 and growing our open-source community
- 🇩🇪 Based in Potsdam

*"Nature's bug detector"* 🦆 – Fun fact: We chose a platypus as our mascot because like this unique creature that defies categorization, we're building something different in the testing space.
